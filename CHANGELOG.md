### ðŸŽ‰ Major Update: Unified Implementation

This release combines the original `mcp-doppler-server` with enhanced intelligence features into a single, unified package.

### Features
- **Unified Codebase**: Single implementation supporting both basic and intelligence features
- **Optional AI Intelligence**: 3 new AI-powered tools (disabled by default):
  - `doppler_get_security_recommendations`: Environment-specific security guidance
  - `doppler_validate_configuration`: Configuration validation against best practices
  - `doppler_troubleshoot_issue`: AI-powered troubleshooting assistance
- **Enhanced Tool Parameters**: Core tools now support optional intelligence parameters:
  - `includeAnalysis`, `validateNaming` on `doppler_list_secrets`
  - `includeContext` on `doppler_get_secret`
  - `validateSecurity`, `checkNaming` on `doppler_set_secret`
  - `autoExclude`, `dryRun` on `doppler_promote_secrets`
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Enable features as needed with `DOPPLER_ENABLE_INTELLIGENCE=true`

### Changes
- **Package Rename**: Now published as `@lepion/mcp-server-doppler`
- **Repository Move**: Now hosted at `github.com/lepion/mcp-server-doppler`
- **Backward Compatibility**: 100% compatible with v0.1.x - no breaking changes
